## (Title)

## Description:
Short description of the project (help explain to us what you are doing)

## Vision Statement:
(what you would tell potential customers) Be sure to follow the guidelines from lecture!

## Motivation: 
for working on this particular project (Why would you develop this?)

## Risks: 
to project completion (these could include:
Working environment or language new to some team members,
No prior experience working with the people on the team,
Lack of availability of some needed resource, etc.)

## Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk:

## List of requirements: for the project
Three separate tables for the requirements:
* User Requirements
* Functional Requirements
* Non-Functional Requirements
 Each requirement must have a unique ID number written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
 Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing:
* Agile sizing – story points
* Time estimate to complete
 All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in  Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.
 [optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
 [optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
 [optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)

## Methodology: 
(Which methodology you plan to follow, though it may change: Waterfall, iterfall, Agile, mash-up of …)

## Project Tracking software:
 Name of the software you will use
 (Trello)
 Link to project tracking software: make sure instructor and TAs have access
 Be sure to continue to use this throughout the semester! Even though these are small projects, the point is to practice the  methodologies and tools used in industry!

## Project plan: 
created from your Project Tracking software. Copy-paste the plan (or screenshot of) from your project tracking software into the repository.
