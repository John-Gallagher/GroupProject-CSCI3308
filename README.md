## Description:
An open source Monopoly clone, utilizing popular memes for the users’ entertainment.

## Vision Statement:
To perpetuate meme culture through the timeless game of monopoly.

## Risks:

## Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk:
 * We will each research Pygames to familiarize ourselves with it

 * We will only use open-source graphics or create our own to take away legal risk
 * We will meet regularly at predefined times to discuss the project, using online tools to schedule
